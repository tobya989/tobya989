### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Developer who does stuff in Serverless, Terraform, AWS stuff and some Node âš¡

I play around with Discord bots, Slack apis, and some other stuff incl. react.
I prefer backend to frontend, Lambdas are fun, especially with the AWS SDK

Currently working on;
- D-Test - An API to help people find better test dates for driving tests!
- Streeem - Video hosting service
- ShortenMeee - URL redirection
