### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Toby, a developer who creates infrastructure, containers, code and uses Serverless, Terraform, AWS and Node âš¡

I play around with API Gateway, Lambdas, databases, storage, systems administration/management and I'm AWS Certified.
Backend/infrastructure is definitely my strong point, using Serverless and Terraform to provision resources, however I am familliar with frameworks such as React.

Curious? Drop me a message!

Currently working on;
- Streeem - Video hosting service
- ShortenMeee - URL redirection
