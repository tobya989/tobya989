### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Toby, a developer who creates infrastructure, containers, code and uses Serverless, Terraform, AWS and Node - looking up towards DevOps âš¡

I play around with AWS and other Cloud Providers. I've earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and most recently Solutions Architect Associate - with an eye to be doing the Security Specialty exam soon.

Architecture, combined with security, is definitely my strong point, using Serverless and Terraform to provision resources, however I am familliar with front-end frameworks such as React.

Curious? Drop me a message!

Currently working on;
- Streeem - Video hosting service
- LessThrown - Reducing food waste
